# qdl-webgui
QDL-WebGUI is an experimental and incomplete UI frontend for qobuz-dl. It is written in PHP.


## Features
- Simple UI. Written in PHP and uses minimal amount of Javascript.
- Search and download albums with a click of a button.
- View genre/discography recommendations by Qobuz.


## Requirements
- An installation of qobuz-dl that's already set up.
- A Qobuz account with an active streaming subscription.
- simplehtmldom installed to the projects directory in the following path: qdlwebgui/lib/simplehtmldom/
  
  (**NEW**: The frontend can now install SimpleHTMLDOM for you)


## To-do list
1. Song previews - Done
2. Label pages - Partially Done
3. Artist pages - Not done
4. Download progress - Done
5. Settings page to edit config.ini - Partially Done
6. Convert links for featured album/discography banners to work with this frontend - Partially Done (Some links are for artist pages which this frontend doesn't have yet. I will have that done soon.)
7. Discogs tagger? - hmm
